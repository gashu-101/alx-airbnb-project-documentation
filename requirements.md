# Technical and Non-Functional Requirements

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Requirements

### 1. Database Management

- Use a relational database such as:
  - **PostgreSQL** or **MySQL**
- **Required Tables**:
  - `Users`: Includes guests and hosts
  - `Properties`: Stores details of property listings
  - `Bookings`: Tracks property bookings
  - `Reviews`: Records user reviews and ratings
  - `Payments`: Manages payment transactions

---

### 2. API Development

- Use **RESTful APIs** to expose backend functionalities to the frontend.
- **HTTP Methods and Status Codes**:
  - `GET`: Retrieve data
  - `POST`: Create data
  - `PUT/PATCH`: Update data
  - `DELETE`: Remove data
- **Optional**:
  - Use **GraphQL** for complex data fetching scenarios.

---

### 3. Authentication and Authorization

- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for secure user sessions.
- Implement **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)** for permissions:
  - **Guests**: Browse and book properties.
  - **Hosts**: Manage property listings.
  - **Admins**: Oversee system operations.

---

### 4. File Storage

- Use **cloud storage** solutions for:
  - Property images
  - User profile photos
- Suggested providers:
  - **AWS S3**
  - **Cloudinary**
- Implementation: File storage for this phase.

---

### 5. Third-Party Services

- Use email services for notifications:
  - **SendGrid**
  - **Mailgun**

---

### 6. Error Handling and Logging

- Implement **global error handling** for APIs.
- Log errors and system events for monitoring and debugging.

---

## üöÄ Non-Functional Requirements

### 1. Scalability

- Use a **modular architecture** to ensure:
  - Easy scalability as traffic increases.
- **Enable horizontal scaling**:
  - Utilize load balancers.

---

### 2. Security

- **Encrypt sensitive data**, such as:
  - Passwords
  - Payment information
- Implement security measures:
  - Firewalls
  - Rate limiting to prevent malicious activities.

---

### 3. Performance Optimization

- Use **caching tools** like:
  - **Redis** to improve response times for frequently accessed data (e.g., search results).
- Optimize database queries to reduce server load.

---

### 4. Testing

- Implement testing strategies:
  - **Unit tests** and **integration tests** using frameworks like **pytest**.
  - **Automated API testing** to ensure endpoints function as expected.
